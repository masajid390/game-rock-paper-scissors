# Developer Notes

I implemented all the original designs, but due to less time, I didn't write unit tests. If you want to take a look at some of the unit tests to get an idea that I could write those. Please have a look at [Unit Test](https://github.com/masajid390/fav-list-with-react-typescript-redux-saga-material-jest-enzyme/tree/master/src/tests)

# Scale Code to Implement Bonus Design

The code I wrote is scalable, and we could implement the Bonus design by doing very little change.

- Update the `controls` list under the file `src/components/game/index.tsx` at line `210`.
- Update the background from `triangle` to `pentagon`.
